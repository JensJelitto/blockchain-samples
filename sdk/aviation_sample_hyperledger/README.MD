#Generic Aviation Sample Contract for Life Limited Parts

** UNDER CONSTRUCTION ** Not ready for derivation at this time.

> ** TBD ** This smart contract is described in a set of documents in the `/docs` folder. See the [README](./docs/README.md) for more information. And please read the introduction and customization documents therein before proceeding through the code base.**

> ** TBD ** This contract is derived from the generic contract in the folder `iot_sample_contract_hyperledger` for the hyperledger fabric. The intent is to demonstrate a complex object model with CRUD APIs for each object type -- airline, airplane, assembly, part, activity.

*See [iot_sample_contract_hyperledger folder](../iot_sample_contract_hyperledger/docs) and [trade_lane_contract_hyperledger folder](../trade_lane_contract_hyperledger/docs) for more information.*
